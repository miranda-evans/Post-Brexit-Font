This is Post-Brexit UK/EU.

Post-Brexit UK is a font without the EU. Post-EU is a font without the UK.

An Oulipian font to make us think about what the world might be like after Brexit.
Use it to redact some classic quotes by politicians to make them into Art™ or see if you can write some constrained poetry where you don’t use the redacted letters.

Remember, without the EU you can’t say: 

Br█xit M█ans Br█xit

Cl█an Br█ak Br█xit 

Or 

G█t Br█xit Don█


Don’t worry though because you can still say : 

Boris Johnson is a dick.
